## Biography

### Preschool (ages 0 - 7)

Sara was born January 6, 2003 to American businesswoman Martha and Russian engineer George in her father's country of birth in the town of Perm. She was an obedient, quiet and calm child. Unlike her peers, she was not fond of dolls, clothes, makeup, fashion, she was more of a LEGOÂ® kid. She also liked swords, armor, bows, magic - all that medieval fantasy stuff. All because of Warcraft, which she was introduced to by her father. 

Since childhood, Sara had to wear glasses because of her vision problems.

Sara was more open and active in socializing than she is today. When communicating with other kids, was open, active, always trying to be first everywhere, better than the others.

### Elementary School (ages 7 - 11)

At the age of 7, Sara went to the first grade at elementary school #439. It was there that she began to develop a dislike for all subjects that required learning something, memorizing, analyzing, and expressing an opinion. Being Russian-speaking, Sara really liked her English classes, either because it was her mom's native language or because of the nice teacher. It's also where she made her best friend for the rest of school - Betty (Beth, Elizabeth, Liza). Having befriended Sara in 3rd grade, Beth has been a great influence on her. Sara appreciated her sense of humor - unsteady, to put it in a word.

At the age of 9, Sara gets her first desktop personal computer. That was the beginning of her introduction to the world of the internet - YouTube, Minecraft, Social Networks, Memes and more.

### Secondary School (ages 12 - 16)

With the transition to secondary school and the advent of the grading system, Sara began to receive her first D's and F's - for subjects that required opening a textbook and reading a paragraph: History, Social Studies, Nature Studies, Geography, Literature - these subjects Sara did not like. However, as for exact sciences, Sara excelled in them, she liked Mathematics and Informatics very much (even attended Olympiads in these subjects and received medals), did well in Physics and Chemistry.

Sara cheated all the time if she had the chance, and with the introduction of a touch screen phone with internet access, she could do it right in class. Tests, assignments, exercises, essays - practically all her homework she copied from the Internet.

At age 12, Betty introduced Sara to anime. Sara's first anime was Monogatari. She quickly got into the taste, and after that she started watching it regularly. Even though Sara is no longer interested in anime at the moment (she has grown out of those cartoons for children), she still likes its style and general atmosphere.

As puberty begins, Sara begins to learn the ins and outs of life as a teenage woman: periods, acne, mood swings - causing her to begin to withdraw into herself. No, Sara had never been an outcast, she just had a hard time finding common topics of conversation with her peers. Sara didn't socialize much with girls because she wasn't interested in "girly" things, and she didn't socialize with boys because she thought they were dumb. For the same reason, Sara wasn't particularly interested in boys, and even if she had crushes, it was just a temporary hormone-induced lapse of judgment.

From the age of 13, Sara began taking additional English courses as her family planned to move from Russia to America, her mother's homeland, when Sara finished school.

At the age of 14, she began to develop a passion for programming. It all started with Sara making simple scripts in python and designing basic web pages. She did it all on her own, using only documentation (and Stackoverflow), without any courses, teachers, or books. Sara didn't like it when someone forcefully tried to shove knowledge at her, to tell her how to do things right. She always preferred to do things her own way, even if it took more time and effort.

### College (ages 17 - 20 (present))

When Sara finished 9th grade of school (she was 16yo), she and her family moved to America, Florida, where she went to Florida Technical College. At first it was very difficult for her to get used to the new atomsphere, culture, language, people. Here Sara had the opportunity to fully exercise her intellectual and technical abilities, as well as learn real programming skills.

Sara is currently in her final year of college, after which she plans to attend university.
